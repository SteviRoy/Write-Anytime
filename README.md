# Write-Anytime
"Write Anytime" is an offline-first text editor that allows users to create notes and code snippets with or without an internet connection. The app features data persistence techniques using IndexedDB, ensuring that users can reliably retrieve their content for later use. The app is also a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed on the user's device and has a registered service worker using Workbox. The client-server folder structure enables a full-stack implementation with proper build scripts for a webpack application. "Write Anytime" also allows users to use next-gen JavaScript and the text editor still functions in the browser without errors. When the user opens the text editor, an IndexedDB database storage is immediately created, and the content is saved automatically when the user clicks off of the DOM window. When the user reopens the text editor after closing it, the content is retrieved from the IndexedDB database.
